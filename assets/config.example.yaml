# Claude Code model for reviewing papers
# This controls which model Claude Code uses when running the review skill.
# Options: sonnet (fast/cheaper), opus (best quality), haiku (fastest/cheapest)
# To use a specific model, launch Claude Code with: claude --model <model>
# Or set in your Claude Code settings.
